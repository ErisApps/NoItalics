# NoItalics
A small mod that unslants all text and images in-game.

This mod was initially made as prize for both Quest and PC users for Day 10 of the **Questmas Board Hub event**.
Anyways, basically what it does is removing all the italics from text, images, buttons, ...

Keep in mind that the UI wasn't really made for this, so some parts might look a bit messed up.
Or... as [@BSMGPink](https://github.com/BSMGPink) stated in [their tweet](https://twitter.com/when_pink/status/1341234382732967937).

    Some of UI is just fucked x3

Anyways, enjoy ^^
